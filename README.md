To insert a blocklist in Pi-hole, add the list's URL in the Group Management > Adlists section of the web interface, then update gravity by clicking Tools > Update Gravity, or run pihole -g in the terminal, which fetches the list and adds domains to your blocking database. You can also manually add individual domains or use the command line for advanced management, but the GUI method is easiest for URL-based lists.
